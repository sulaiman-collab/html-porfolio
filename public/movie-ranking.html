<h1>The Best Movies According to Sulaiman</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Game Of Throne</h3>
<p>This is my favourite. I just love everything about it. Power, persuasion, betrayal, whom to trust etc. Just everything. </p>
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>Love how smart Michael Scofield is. </p>
<h3>The Pursuit Of Happiness</h3>
<p>Here life is already hard being a man. But giving up is never an option (: </p>

<p>Sorry if you didn't get to see your favourite movies here. I'm poor at watching movies. <br/> Anything that will help me change my mind i'll be glad to try it out.   </p>
